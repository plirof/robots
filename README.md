Building
--------

Ensure you have the following programs installed: make, python (2.7.x), lame, espeak.

 * On a Mac, [install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and then run the `bootstrap.sh` script.
 * On Ubuntu Linux these can be installed with:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential lame python espeak

To build, use the command:

    make

Output ends up in `./built/dev/`

Running
-------

Open `built/dev/robots.html` in a modern web browser (Firefox, Chrome, or Safari).

For example, type this command:

    firefox built/dev/robots.html
